1. Serious bug fixes
  * Fix problem with models that had group-specific coefficients, which were mislabled.
    Although the parameters were estimated correctly, users of previous versions of
    rstanarm should run such models again to obtain correct summaries and posterior
    predictions. Thanks to someone named Luke for pointing this problem out on stan-users.
2. Bug fixes
  * Vignettes now view correctly on the CRAN webiste thanks to Yihui Xie
  * Fix problem with models without intercepts thanks to Paul-Christian Buerkner
  * Fix problem with specifying binomial 'size' for posterior_predict using newdata
  * Fix problem with lme4-style formulas that use the same grouping factor multiple times
  * Fix conclusion in rstanarm vignette thanks to someone named Michael
3. Features
  * Group-specific design matrices are kept sparse throughout to reduce memory consumption
  * The log_lik() function now has a newdata argument
